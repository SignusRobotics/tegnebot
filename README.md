# Tegnebot

Code recovered from project report. Part of a group project. 

ABB RobotStudio in combination with MATLAB Computer Vision
System Toolbox to recreate a match of Tic-tac-toe match using a robotic arm and a webcam. 

My main contribution was the OCR part written in MATLAB and integrating it with the code controlling the robotic arm.
